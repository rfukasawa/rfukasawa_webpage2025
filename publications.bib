While the most successful formulations for several deterministic vehicle-routing problem variants are based on a set-partitioning formulation, adapting such formulations for the CVRPSD under mild assumptions on the demands remains challenging. In this work we provide an explanation to such challenge, by proving that when demands are given as a finite set of scenarios, solving the LP relaxation of such formulation is strongly NP-Hard. We also prove a hardness result for the case of independent normal demands.}

abstract = {The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) consists of finding the cheapest way to serve a set of customers with a fleet of vehicles of a given capacity. While serving a particular customer, each vehicle picks up its demand and carries its weight throughout the rest of its route. While costs in the classical CVRP are measured in terms of a given arc distance, the Cumulative Vehicle Routing Problem (CmVRP) is a variant of the problem that aims to minimize total energy consumption. Each arc’s energy consumption is defined as the product of the arc distance by the weight accumulated since the beginning of the route. The purpose of this work is to propose several different formulations for the CmVRP and to study their Linear Programming (LP) relaxations. In particular, the goal is to study formulations based on combining an arc-item concept (that keeps track of whether a given customer has already been visited when traversing a specific arc) with another formulation from the recent literature, the Arc-Load formulation (that determines how much load goes through an arc). Both formulations have been studied independently before – the Arc-Item is very similar to a multi-commodity-flow formulation in Letchford and Salazar-González (2015) and the Arc-Load formulation has been studied in Fukasawa et al. (2016) – and their LP relaxations are incomparable. Nonetheless, we show that a formulation combining the two (called Arc-Item-Load) may lead to a significantly stronger LP relaxation, thereby indicating that the two formulations capture complementary aspects of the problem. In addition, we study how set partitioning based formulations can be combined with these formulations. We present computational experiments on several well-known benchmark instances that highlight the advantages and drawbacks of the LP relaxation of each formulation and point to potential avenues of future research.}

abstract="We consider the bilevel knapsack problem with interdiction constraints, a fundamental bilevel integer programming problem which generalizes the 0-1 knapsack problem. In this problem, there are two knapsacks and n items. The objective is to select some items to pack into the first knapsack such that the maximum profit attainable from packing some of the remaining items into the second knapsack is minimized. We present a combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithm which outperforms the current state-of-the-art solution method in computational experiments by 4.5 times on average for all instances reported in the literature. On many of the harder instances, our algorithm is hundreds of times faster, and we solved 53 of the 72 previously unsolved instances. Our result relies fundamentally on a new dynamic programming algorithm which computes very strong lower bounds. This dynamic program solves a relaxation of the problem from bilevel to 2n-level where the items are processed in an online fashion. The relaxation is easier to solve but approximates the original problem surprisingly well in practice. We believe that this same technique may be useful for other interdiction problems.",

abstract = {This paper introduces the price-elastic knapsack problem (PEKP), an extension of the classic knapsack problem where instead of fixed item characteristics, the weight of each item and the profit from including an item in the knapsack are a function of a parameter, namely the price. PEKP is first formulated as a generic nonlinear optimization problem and three special cases are investigated. First, we show a polynomial-time solvable case. Next, we formulate the case where the item weights are affine-linear functions as a quadratic program. The computational results show that solving the quadratic program to optimality is computationally challenging, and thus, an approach that decomposes the problem into three mixed integer programs is proposed. Similarly, the case where the weights of the items are piecewise-linear functions is investigated and a quadratic formulation is proposed. A solution approach based on decomposing the problem into three mixed integer programs that are solved independently is also proposed. Using randomly generated instances of varying sizes, the computational results show that the proposed decomposition leads to significant computational advantages compared to solving the quadratic program in the cases of affine-linear and piecewise-linear functions.}
