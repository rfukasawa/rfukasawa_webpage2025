I am a Professor at the <a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/co">Department of Combinatorics and Optimization</a> of the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a>.


I did my PhD in 
<a href="https://aco.gatech.edu/">Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization</a>
at <a href="http://www.gatech.edu">GeorgiaTech</a> under the supervision of <a
href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~bico/">Bill Cook</a>. 

I was  the recipient
of the 2008-2009 IBM Herman Goldstine postdoctoral fellowship and an <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/early-researcher-awards">Early
Research Award</a>.

My research interests are on cutting planes for general mixed-integer programming, computational mixed-integer programming, operations research and the solution of combinatorial optimization problems, in particular vehicle routing and similar problems.
