abstract: This paper introduces the price-elastic knapsack problem (PEKP), an extension
  of the classic knapsack problem where instead of fixed item characteristics, the
  weight of each item and the profit from including an item in the knapsack are a
  function of a parameter, namely the price. PEKP is first formulated as a generic
  nonlinear optimization problem and three special cases are investigated. First,
  we show a polynomial-time solvable case. Next, we formulate the case where the item
  weights are affine-linear functions as a quadratic program. The computational results
  show that solving the quadratic program to optimality is computationally challenging,
  and thus, an approach that decomposes the problem into three mixed integer programs
  is proposed. Similarly, the case where the weights of the items are piecewise-linear
  functions is investigated and a quadratic formulation is proposed. A solution approach
  based on decomposing the problem into three mixed integer programs that are solved
  independently is also proposed. Using randomly generated instances of varying sizes,
  the computational results show that the proposed decomposition leads to significant
  computational advantages compared to solving the quadratic program in the cases
  of affine-linear and piecewise-linear functions.
