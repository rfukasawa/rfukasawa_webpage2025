abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) consists of finding the cheapest
  way to serve a set of customers with a fleet of vehicles of a given capacity. While
  serving a particular customer, each vehicle picks up its demand and carries its
  weight throughout the rest of its route. While costs in the classical CVRP are measured
  in terms of a given arc distance, the Cumulative Vehicle Routing Problem (CmVRP)
  is a variant of the problem that aims to minimize total energy consumption. Each
  arc’s energy consumption is defined as the product of the arc distance by the weight
  accumulated since the beginning of the route. The purpose of this work is to propose
  several different formulations for the CmVRP and to study their Linear Programming
  (LP) relaxations. In particular, the goal is to study formulations based on combining
  an arc-item concept (that keeps track of whether a given customer has already been
  visited when traversing a specific arc) with another formulation from the recent
  literature, the Arc-Load formulation (that determines how much load goes through
  an arc). Both formulations have been studied independently before – the Arc-Item
  is very similar to a multi-commodity-flow formulation in Letchford and Salazar-González
  (2015) and the Arc-Load formulation has been studied in Fukasawa et al. (2016) –
  and their LP relaxations are incomparable. Nonetheless, we show that a formulation
  combining the two (called Arc-Item-Load) may lead to a significantly stronger LP
  relaxation, thereby indicating that the two formulations capture complementary aspects
  of the problem. In addition, we study how set partitioning based formulations can
  be combined with these formulations. We present computational experiments on several
  well-known benchmark instances that highlight the advantages and drawbacks of the
  LP relaxation of each formulation and point to potential avenues of future research.
